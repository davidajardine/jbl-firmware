# JBL Firmware Files
This repository contains firmware files for JBL Bluetooth speakers. All of those are official and were downloaded from the [JBL server](http://storage.harman.com/), except for the Charge 2 one, which I got from somewhere else online I don't remember.

*NOTE: All firmware files marked as 8.8.8, 888 or similar are only for testing purposes and were never released publicly.*

Some models have different chipsets (CSR, QCC, or Vimicro), so make sure to use correct files from corresponding directories. You can use [ConnectPlus](https://github.com/pembem22/connect-plus/) app to check what chipset speaker has.
