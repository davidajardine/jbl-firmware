Contributing Missing Firmware for JBL PartyBox 300 (Harman_G1.HUI)

This is the official firmware upgrade file I received directly from JBL/Harman customer support. I'm contributing it to this repo to help others preserve access and avoid loss of functionality due to firmware-related issues.

This update installs firmware 381221, which primarily addresses audio sync issues across multiple PartyBox speakers.

ðŸ“„ Installation instructions are included in the attached PDF.

ðŸ’¡ Note: To prevent the auto power-off issue, insert a Â¼" (6.35mm) TRS or TS jack into the mic input port and set the mic volume to zero. This tricks the system into remaining active by detecting a "live" input and stops it from shutting down due to inactivity.
